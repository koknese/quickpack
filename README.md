To be able to use this extension, you need to go through all 15 cirlces of Firefox extension hell, such as zipping the extension into an .xpi, then getting it signed by Mozilla. There are surely some kind of ways if I recall to install it without all this, however I recommend waiting for when I figure out how to make the users add their own API keys in a GUI.
